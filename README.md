# Food and Stuff

My simple eCommerce project built for learning purposes. It has products, cart logic, notification system, payment processing. Created in React from scratch using hooks and react context for managing global state. Products data is provided from contentful CDN. I implemented payment processing with stripe testing version. App is hosted on Netlify so i provide link to live demo.
