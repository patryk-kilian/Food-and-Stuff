# Food and Stuff

My simple eCommerce project with products and cart logic. Created in React from scratch using hooks and react context for managing global state. Products data is provided from contentful CDN. Site is hosted on Netlify so i provide link to live demo version. I have few things to do with this project so it is not finished yet.

## Tools

- create react app - starting point
- emotion (css in js) - for styling
- reach router - for routing
- react context as state manager
- contentful - for products data providing
- react framer motion - great libary for react animations, using it for cart mounting and unmounting animation
- netlify - for free hosting
